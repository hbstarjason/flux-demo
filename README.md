# Getting Started with Flux on Okteto Cloud

This example shows how to use [Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/) on [Okteto Cloud]() to enable continuous delivery of container images, using version control for each step to ensure deployment is reproducible, auditable and revertible.  Deploy code as fast as your team creates it, confident that you can easily revert if required.

This is the application used for the [Okteto Cloud meets GitOps](https://okteto.com/blog/okteto-cloud-meets-gitops/) blog post.
